## Installing Dependencies
I've used go-vips(a wrapper around class for libvips). Dependencies that are needed.

1) If on OSX then set:
```
export CGO_CFLAGS_ALLOW="-Xpreprocessor"
```

2) Install to packages namely `pkg-config` and `vips`.

## Building the Project

To build the project, use the following command:

```sh
go build -o build/con cmd/main.go
```

## Running the Project

To run the project, use the following command:

```sh
./build/con input.jpg
```

Currently, the app expects a JPEG file to be passed as an argument and only converts it to a PNG file.
